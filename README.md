This sample application shows how to read and write from a [MIFARE Classic] 
(http://www.nxp.com/documents/data_sheet/MF1S503x.pdf) card using an HID reader 
like the [OMNIKEY 5421] (http://www.hidglobal.com/products/readers/omnikey/5421)

The sample uses industry standard commands from the [PC/SC Specification]
